Welcome to the Blogging Platform project! This web application aims to create a dynamic and secure platform where users can engage through blog posts and comments.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Functional Web Application
   - Develop a blogging platform with features for user registration, login, blog post creation/editing, and commenting.

### 2. Dynamic Web Pages
   -  I Utilize EJS to render dynamic views displaying user-generated content, such as blog posts and comments.

### 3. Secure User Authentication
   - I Implement secure registration and login processes with encrypted passwords.
   - I Implement session management to enhance user authentication.

### 4. Interactive API
   - I Create backend routes that dynamically respond to CRUD operations.
   - I used robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, whether using Passport or an alternative.

### 5. Validated Inputs
I Validate all form inputs to ensure correct format.
   -  inputs before processing to prevent security vulnerabilities.

### 6. Optimized Database
   - I Optimize data retrieval in MongoDB by using indexed fields.

### 7. Positive Testing Outcomes
   - Conduct Postman tests for all API endpoints.
   - Ensure the tests demonstrate correct responses and effective error handling.
